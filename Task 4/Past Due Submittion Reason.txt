Respected Sir, 

I already completed this task during class time but was unable to commit because I had no electricity from 12:00 pm to 4:00 pm. Today 
I realized that I forgot to commit this task, is it ok if you could still consider this task and I am ready to accept any penalty for this late submission.

Respectfully 
Saifullah
