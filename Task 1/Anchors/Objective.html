        <p>My aim/objective in life is to become a self relient person who dosent have to depend on anyone else. I wish to complete my undergrad without any issues and also hope to graduate with enough skills that can help me with my carreer. I also wish to attend grad school which will allow me to gain further knowledge about my undergrad course.</p>
