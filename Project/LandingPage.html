      <h3>Reasons You Should Go To The Gym</h3>
      <p>
        Your body might feel achy and sore immediately after you exercise, and
        it probably won’t feel too great during the workout, either. But
        strengthening your body is keeping it in shape to fight off illness and
        prevent it from becoming flabby and weak.Exercise doesn’t just
        strengthen your muscles, it also strengthens your heart and bones,
        lowers your blood pressure and of course, reduces your body fat.
      </p>

      <h3>Benifits of regular physical activity</h3>
      <p>
        Exercise can help prevent excess weight gain or help maintain weight
        loss. When you engage in physical activity, you burn calories. The more
        intense the activity, the more calories you burn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Worried about heart disease? Hoping to prevent high blood pressure? No
        matter what your current weight is, being active boosts high-density
        lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the "good" cholesterol, and it decreases
        unhealthy triglycerides. This one-two punch keeps your blood flowing
        smoothly, which decreases your risk of cardiovascular diseases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Need an emotional lift? Or need to blow off some steam after a stressful
        day? A <strong>gym</strong> session or brisk walk can help. Physical
        activity stimulates various brain chemicals that may leave you feeling
        happier, more relaxed and less anxious.
